Its a logical isolation for objects, resources etc
We have a namespace if we don't create any - default ns. created by k8s at the time of setup
k8s create some pods and services for internal purpose(for networking solution, dns etc...) under ns kube-system to isolate it from users.
Resources available for user are cretaen in kube-public ns.
*Customm namespace to isolate ur different envs and its resources. so no accidental modification to other resources.
 each ns can have their own set of polocies, like who can do what.
 can assign certain resource quota to each ns so ns can't use more resource than allowed.
 
 to get resources (pods,services,deploy etc...) for a namespace use
 kubectl get po --namespace=dev OR kubectl get deploy --n dev
 kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=dev  (after setting context no need to use namespace flag)
 kubectl get po --all-namespaces
 
 Creating Resource Quota for ns
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: ResourceQuota
 metadata:
     name: dev-quota
	 namespace: dev
spec:
   hard:
     pods: "10"
	 requests.cpu: "4"
	 requests.memory: 5Gi
	 limits.cpu: "10"
	 limits.memory: 10Gi
