Every org has some rules/compliance. so compliance for deploying new resource in k8s is handled by kyverno.
It enforces policies, governance and compliance on ur k8s cluster.
earlier we used to write addmission controller for the same but its hard and complicated.(eg. no latest tag, resource req./limit)
*admission controller validate, mutate req. of authenticated and authorised user.
  - its in go lang.
  - if we have admission controller written and depoyed in k8s,every req. in k8s goes through kubeapi server and then through admission controller which
    will validate new resources create/update req. against rules.

For every rule we need to write one admission controller and we may have hundreds of them, maintaining and updating(if required) is hard & time consuming.
* Keyverno creates dynamic admission controller create some webhook config.
It does 4 things(funcionality):
 1. Generate - eg. create network policy whenever a namespace is created.
 2. Validate - eg. block user to use latest tag.
 3. Mutate - eg. attach pod security policy that is created without any pod security policy config.
 4. Verify images - verify images used are properly signed and verfied(OIC policy followed containers).

* Required Infra. 
  - k8s cluster
  - install kyverno:
      * cretate dedicated namespace
      1. manifest file - https://kyverno.io/docs/installation/
      2. Helm (Recommended for prod) - https://kyverno.io/docs/installation/
*Basic kyverno policy yaml file
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: disallow-latest-tag
  annotations:
spec:
  validationFailureAction: audit  -(this action sould be enforce if u want kyverno to work)
  background: true
  rules:
  - name: require-image-tag
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    validate:
      message: "An image tag is required."
      pattern:
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: "*:*"
  - name: validate-image-tag
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    validate:
      message: "Using a mutable image tag e.g. 'latest' is not allowed."
      pattern:
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: "!*:latest"

----------------
To use alredy made kyverno policies go to kyverno github link and open the policy in raw yaml format. 
then kubectl apply -f <raw github link>  will deploy the policy.
