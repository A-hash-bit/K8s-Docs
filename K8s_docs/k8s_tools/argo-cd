# Argo-CD is a GitOps tool.
- We use git for source code and connect it to CI(jenkins) tool for continious integration. And same can be applied to kubernetes manifest also.
- git will single point of truth for Argo-CD and chnages can be pulled or pushed.
- deploy Argo-CD controller on k8s.
- if someone make manual change to k8s cluster then Argo overrides it. It keeps cache of k8s state and continiously compares it with GIT.
- maintain version for manifest.
