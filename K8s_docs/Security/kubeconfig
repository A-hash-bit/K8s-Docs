to connect to k8s cluster we need server specification (name, address etc), --client-key admin.key, admin.crt, ca.crt
and need to pass this info with every cmd. its tidious. so we save all this info inside a file called kubeconfig.
by default kubectl looks for file named config under dir .kube in users home. create it there then no need to pass file explicitly.
$HOME/.kube/config
   file has 3 sections 1. cluster (dev,prod) --single or multiple clusters 
                          server specification is added in this section.
                       2. users (admin, dev user, prod user) ---who has access to cluster.
                          admin.key, admin.crt goes in this section.
                       3. context (combination of one cluster and one user) e.g. admin@prod
*kubeconfig file is in a yaml format.
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: Config
 current-context: <any context that u want>
 clusters:
 - name: my-cluster
   cluster:
     certificate-authority: /path/to/ca.crt
     server: https://my-cluster:<port>
 - name: can have multiple values
 context:
  - name: my-admin@my-cluster
    context: 
      cluster: my-cluster
      user: my-admin
      namespace: <name=space>  -----so if u switch config context then ns context will also change. 
   - name: can have multiple values
 users: 
  - name: my-admin
    user:
      client-certificate: /path/to/admin.crt
      client-key: /path/to/admin.key
  - name: can have multiple values

* to view and modify kubecongif file.
  -> kubectl config view
* how to change context
  -> kubectl config use-context <context-name>
